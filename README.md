I decided to complete this challenge using Vanilla JS at first and then with React. 
Both present their own difficulties, but React obviously allowing for much a cleaner and easier way to structure the code. 
On the other hand, publishing the Vanilla version is gonna allow people to see how they can clean it up further.
For styling, I've implemented a mix of BEM and property-value pair methodoligies, which is not ideal, but is fine to work with.
Created using Vite, to start type "npm run dev".
